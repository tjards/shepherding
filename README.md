# Shepherding via Pinning ControlThis project implements shepherding for a group of dynamic agents. We extend the work in [van Havermaet (2023)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.230015) to 3D andincorporate the collision avoidance technique in [Olfati-Saber (2006)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1605401) to maintain separation between shepherds.Note:This project includes significant improvements that will form the basis of the next iteration of [multi-agent_sim](https://github.com/tjards/multi-agent_sim) .## DemonstrationsShepherding using van Havermaet technique with Olfati-Saber obstacle avoidance:<p float="center">    <img src="./Figs_visible/animation3D_cool4.gif" width="60%"></p><p float="center">    <img src="./Figs_visible/target_dist.png" width="30%">    <img src="./Figs_visible/agent_separation.png" width="30%"></p>## CitingThe code is opensource but, if you reference this work in your own reserach, please cite me.
